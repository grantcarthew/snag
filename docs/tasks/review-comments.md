# Review Code Comments

Your task is to do a code comment review that will look for comments that do not add value to the code base, and remove them.

Guidance:

- Read all \*.go files, every go file MUST be reviewed for useless comments
- This is not a lib, go doc comments are not needed
- Remove comments that simply repeat easily readable code
- Ensure comments that explain why a construct exists are retained
