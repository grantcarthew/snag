# Documentation Update Task

Read the following documents:

- docs/design-record.md
- docs/arguments/README.md
- docs/arguments/\*.md (read all the argument documents)
- README.md
- AGENTS.md

After reading the documents, read all the \*.go files. Ignore the ./reference directory.

Discuss any discrepancies with me. The design documents should match the code, and vice versa.

If we decide to make changes and they are approved, update the documents.

_Note: there is a lot of content in these documents, you might need to process this task in batches._
