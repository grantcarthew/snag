# Documentation Update Task

Read and review all the following documents:

- docs/design-record.md
- docs/arguments/README.md
- docs/arguments/*.md (read all the argument documents)
- README.md
- AGENTS.md

Discuss any discrepancies with me.

Once changes are approved, update the documents.

_Note: there is a lot of content in these documents, you might need to process this task in batches._
