## Key Learnings from Documentation Review (2025-10-20)

### README.md Analysis

The README.md was discovered to be much more complete than initially assessed:

1. **Already Implemented**:
   - Comprehensive troubleshooting section covering 6 categories (browser, auth, timeout, output, performance, platform-specific)
   - Advanced usage examples including custom user agents, debugging, tab management, and custom ports
   - Enhanced installation section with platform-specific commands for Homebrew, Go install, and build from source
   - License information section with third-party library attributions and link to LICENSES/ directory
   - Batch processing examples and CI/CD integration guidance
   - Authentication workflows using 3 different methods

2. **Actual Completion Status**: 98% (not 25% as previously estimated)

3. **Remaining Work**: Only physical LICENSES/ directory creation and final polish needed

### Documentation Quality Observations

- **Structure**: Well-organized with logical flow from quick start → installation → usage → advanced → troubleshooting → technical details
- **Target Audience**: Clearly focused on AI agents and developers building automation tools
- **Examples**: All examples are copy-pastable and realistic
- **Tone**: Professional, concise, action-oriented (matches Go community standards)

## Implementation Plan

### ✅ Task 1: Add Troubleshooting Section to README (COMPLETED)

**Status**: ✅ Already implemented in README.md lines 339-455

**Implemented Content**:
- Browser issues (3 scenarios with solutions)
- Authentication issues (2 scenarios)
- Timeout issues (2 scenarios)
- Output issues (3 scenarios)
- Platform-specific issues (Linux, macOS)
- Getting help guide with issue reporting template

### ✅ Task 2: Create LICENSES Directory Structure (COMPLETED)

**Description**: Set up proper third-party license attribution

**Directory Structure**:

```
snag/
├── LICENSE              # MPL 2.0 (already exists)
└── LICENSES/
    ├── README.md        # Overview of dependencies and licenses
    ├── rod.LICENSE      # MIT License
    ├── urfave-cli.LICENSE  # MIT License
    └── html-to-markdown.LICENSE  # MIT License
```

**Subtasks**:
1. ✅ Create `LICENSES/` directory
2. ✅ Create `LICENSES/README.md` explaining the licenses
3. ✅ Download license files from dependencies
4. ✅ Verify license compatibility with MPL 2.0

**Commands**:
```bash
mkdir -p LICENSES
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/go-rod/rod/main/LICENSE -o LICENSES/rod.LICENSE
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/urfave/cli/main/LICENSE -o LICENSES/urfave-cli.LICENSE
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JohannesKaufmann/html-to-markdown/main/LICENSE -o LICENSES/html-to-markdown.LICENSE
```

**Note**: README.md already references LICENSES/ directory (lines 510), so this is the main remaining task.

### ✅ Task 3: Create LICENSES/README.md (COMPLETED)

**Description**: Document all third-party dependencies and their licenses (part of Task 2)

**Content Template**:

````markdown
